<article class="post-content">
  <script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script>

<p>If you are not familiar with neural art, you must heard about <a href="http://prisma-ai.com">PRISMA</a>. Prisma transforms your photos into works of art using the styles of famous artists.
It's not a normal filter you can see on the instagram or the other app, AI, exactly, neural networks is the core of it.
Today we will go through the paper published by Gatys, L. et al <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576">A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style</a>
and see how can a neural network become an artist!
</p>

<p>They conjecture that a image can be seperated into two components, content and style. Content is what's exactly in the image,
for example, objects, view, background, etc. Style is an abstract term which represents the visual experiences of an image.
This paper use neural networks to seperate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images,
providing a powerful algorithm for the creation of artistic images.
</p>

<center><p><img src="/blogpost/images/neuralart/ex1.png" alt="Teaser" /></p></center>

<p>Paper use a Convolutional Neural Networks trained on object recognition to extract the content and style
since the pre-trained network can make object information more clear compared to the random initialized network.
They use the convolutional layer of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.1556.pdf">VGG-Network</a> (conv1 to conv5)
as there CNN, extract feature response from each layer.
</p>

<h2>Content</h2>
<p>We will feed the target image into the pre-trained CNN, output of each layer will become a feature representation of the image
which we refer them as content representation. For VGG, since we have five concolutoinal layer, we will have five different hierarchical feature. By this kind of procedure,
we extract the actual content of the image compared to its detailed pixel values.
</p>

<p>To visualise the image information that is encoded at different layers of the hierarchy (see the figure below),
we perform gradient descent on a white noise image to find another image that matches the feature responses of the original image.
We define the loss at layer l as the squared-error (L) of feature representation (F, P) from the image that is generated (x) and the original image (p).
</p>

<center><p><img src="/blogpost/images/neuralart/loss_c.png" alt="Teaser" /></p></center>

<p>
Then we calculate the derivative of this loss with respect to the "activations in layer" (F) not paramater (we will talk about it later).
</p>

<center><p><img src="/blogpost/images/neuralart/d_c.png" alt="Teaser" /></p></center>

<p>
Thus we can change the generative image iteratelly until it generates the same response in a certain layer of the CNN we want to visualize.
The output from lower layer (conv1, conv2) retain
more pixel information however we loss these information in the output from higher layer (conv4, conv5). In contrast, we gain
high level information in those higher layer features.
</p>

<h2>Style</h2>
<p>We can obtain the feature representation of style using the CNN too. However this time, we will assemble the feature from different
layers to obtain a stationary, multi-scale representation of the input image which can capture its texture informations. For instance,
we can combine the output from conv1, conv2 and conv3 to form a feature correlation.
</p>
<p>
Again, we can visualize them by
reconstructing an image that matches the style representation of a given input image. The visualization procedure is quite similar to previous session,
but this time we minimise the mean-squared distance of feature correlations (G, A) from the image that is generated (x) and the original image (a).
We use Gram matrix (G) which uses inner product to calculate the corelation between feature map i, j in layer l.
</p>

<center><p><img src="/blogpost/images/neuralart/loss_s.png" alt="Teaser" /></p></center>
<center><p><img src="/blogpost/images/neuralart/g.png" alt="Teaser" /></p></center>

<p>
Finally the lossse from different layer will be aggregated by weighted sum.
</p>

<center><p><img src="/blogpost/images/neuralart/lay_loss.png" alt="Teaser" /></p></center>

<p>
After calculating the derivative, we can generate the style representation for different subset of layers.
</p>

<center><p><img src="/blogpost/images/neuralart/d_s.png" alt="Teaser" /></p></center>

<p>
Here's the figure from the paper, illustrating the procedure of extracting content and style representation.
</p>

<center><p><img src="/blogpost/images/neuralart/f1.png" alt="Teaser" /></p></center>

<h2>Create Artistic Images</h2>
<p>To generate a image with artistic style, we jointly minimise the distance of a white noise image from the content representation
of the photograph in one layer of the network and the style representation of the painting in a number of layers of the CNN.
The total loss can be abtained by the weighted sum of two loss, using certain weighting factors.
</p>

<center><p><img src="/blogpost/images/neuralart/tot_loss.png" alt="Teaser" /></p></center>

<p>
Feature from different layer
and distinct weighting factors will result in various output image. All of the training details are in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576">paper</a>.
</p>



<h2>Generative model</h2>
<p>Before we go into the next session, we will talk about an important concept called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model">generative model</a>.
Here's the definition from wikipedia: a generative model is a model for randomly generating observable data values, typically given some hidden parameters.
Neural art is one of the application of generative model. We create artistic image by reconstructing image from high level feature from
the output of different convolutional layer which is quite different from the traditional task like classification or recognition.
Recently more and more papers talk about generative model, it might be the next hot topic in computer vision and machine learning.
</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
There are several extend works like <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05897">Preserving Color in Neural Artistic Style Transfer</a>,
or even for video, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.08610">Artistic style transfer for videos</a>. Some codes have been implemented:
<a href="https://github.com/woodrush/neural-art-tf">Tensorflow</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kaishengtai/neuralart">Torch</a>.
If you don't have gpu to run those codes, don't worry, we can still use Prisma to give it a try; their team must done lots of
work to make the whole process real-time. Anyway, hope to see more cool applications from them.

<p>In the last couple of years, a number of papers (like <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/12/3618.abstract">this paper from JHU/Brown</a>, and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.8027">this one from MPI</a>) have suggested that the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA, for short) can be used as an alternative Turing Test. The task involves answering an open-ended question (or a series of questions) about an image. An example is shown below:</p>

<h5 id="image-from-visualqaorg">Image from visualqa.org</h5>
<p><img src="/images/vqa/challenge.png" alt="Visual QA" /></p>

<p>The AI system needs to solve a number of sub-problems in Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision, in addition to being able to perform some kind of “common-sense” reasoning. It needs to localize the subject being referenced (the woman’s face, and more specifically the region around her lips), needs to detect objects (the banana), and should also have some common-sense knowledge that the word <em>mustache</em> is often used to refer to markings or objects on the face that are not actually mustaches (like milk mustaches). Since the problem cuts through two two very different modalities (vision and text), and requires high-level understanding of the scene, it appears to be an ideal candidate for a true Turing Test. The problem also has real world applications, like helping the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vizwiz/id439686043?mt=8">visually impaired</a>.</p>

<p>A few days ago, the <a href="http://visualqa.org/challenge.html">Visual QA Challenge</a> was launched, and along with it came a large dataset (~750K questions on ~250K images). After the <a href="http://mscoco.org/dataset/#captions-challenge2015">MS COCO Image Captioning Challenge</a> sparked a lot of interest in problem of <a href="https://pdollar.wordpress.com/2015/01/21/image-captioning/">image captioning</a> (or was it the interest that led to the challenge?), the time seems ripe to move onto a much harder problem at the intersection of NLP and Vision.</p>

<p>This post will present ways to model this problem using Neural Networks, exploring both Feedforward Neural Networks, and the much more exciting <strong>Recurrent Neural Networks</strong> (LSTMs, to be specific). If you do not know much about Neural Networks, then I encourage you to check these two awesome blogs: <a href="https://colah.github.io">Colah’s Blog</a> and <a href="https://karpathy.github.io">Karpathy’s Blog</a>. Specifically, check out the posts on Recurrent Neural Nets, Convolutional Neural Nets and LSTM Nets. The models in this post take inspiration from <a href="https://filebox.ece.vt.edu/~parikh/Publications/ICCV2015_VQA.pdf">this ICCV 2015 paper</a>, <a href="https://www.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/sites/default/files/iccv15-neural_qa.pdf">this ICCV 2015 paper</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~mren/imageqa/">this NIPS 2015 paper</a>.</p>

<h2 id="generating-answers">Generating Answers</h2>
<p>An important aspect of solving this problem is to have a system that can generate new answers. While most of the answers in the VQA dataset are short (1-3 words), we would still like to a have a system that can generate arbitrarily long answers, keeping up with our spirit of the Turing test. We can perhaps take inspiration from papers on <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215">Sequence to Sequence Learning using RNNs</a>, that solve a similar problem when generating translations of arbitrary length. <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5411-a-multi-world-approach-to-question-answering-about-real-world-scenes-based-on-uncertain-input.pdf">Multi-word methods</a> have been presented for VQA too. However, for the purpose of this blog post, we will ignore this aspect of the problem. We will select the 1000 most frequent answers in the VQA training dataset, and solve the problem in a multi-class classification setting. These top 1000 answers cover over 80% of the answers in the VQA training set, so we can still expect to get reasonable results.</p>

<h2 id="the-feedforward-neural-model">The Feedforward Neural Model</h2>
<p><img src="/images/vqa/model_1.jpg" alt="The MLP Model" /></p>

<p>To get started, let’s first try to model the problem using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron">MultiLayer Perceptron</a>. An MLP is a simple feedforward neural net that maps a feature vector (of fixed length) to an appropriate output. In our problem, this output will be a probability distribution over the set of possible answers. We will be using <a href="http://keras.io">Keras</a>, an awesome deep learning library based on <a href="http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/">Theano</a>, and written in Python. Setting up Keras is fairly easy, just have a look at their <a href="https://github.com/fchollet/keras#installation">readme</a> to get started.</p>

<p>In order to use the MLP model, we need to map all our input questions and images to a feature vector of fixed length. We perform the following operations to achieve this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>For the question, we transform each word to its <a href="https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/">word vector</a>, and sum up all the vectors. The length of this feature vector will be same as the length of a single word vector, and the word vectors (also called embeddings) that we use have a length of <code>300</code>.</li>
  <li>For the image, we pass it through a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (the well-known <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.1556">VGG Architecture</a>), and extract the activation from the second last layer (before the softmax layer, that is). Size of this feature vector is <code>4096</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once we have generated the feature vectors, all we need to do now is to define a model in Keras, set up a cost function and an optimizer, and we’re good to go.
The following Keras code defines a multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers, <code>1024</code> hidden units in each layer and dropout layers in the middle for regularization. The final layer is a softmax layer, and is responsible for generating the probability distribution over the set of possible answers. I have used the <code>categorical_crossentropy</code> loss function since it is a multi-class classification problem. The <code>rmsprop</code> method is used for optimzation. You can try experimenting with other optimizers, and see what kind of <a href="http://lossfunctions.tumblr.com/">learning curves</a> you get.</p>

<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/avisingh599/visual-qa/blob/master/scripts/trainMLP.py">entire python script</a> to see the code for generating the features and training the network. It does not access the hard disk once the training begins, and uses about ~4GB of RAM. You can reduce memory usage by lowering the <code>batchSize</code> variable, but that would also lead to longer training times. It is able to process over 215K image-question pairs in less than <strong>160 seconds/epoch</strong> when working on a GTX 760 GPU with a batch size of 128. I ran my experiments for 100 epochs.</p>

<h2 id="the-recurrent-neural-model">The Recurrent Neural Model</h2>
<p><img src="/images/vqa/lstm_encoder.jpg" alt="The LSTM Model" align="middle" style="width: 500px;" /></p>

<p>A drawback of the previous approach is that we ignore the sequential nature of the questions. Regardless of what order the words appear in, we’ll get the same vector representing the question, à la <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model">bag-of-words (BOW)</a>. A way to tackle this limitation is by use of <a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/">Recurrent Neural Networks</a>, which are well-suited for sequential data. We’ll be using <a href="http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/">LSTMs</a> here, since they avoid some common nuances of vanilla RNNs, and often give a slightly better performance. You can also experiment with other recurrent layers in Keras, such as <code>GRU</code>. The word vectors corresponding to the tokens in the question are passed to an LSTM in a sequential fashion, and the output of the LSTM (from its output gate) after all the tokens have been passed is chosen as the representation for the entire question. This fixed length vector is concatenated with the <code>4096</code> dimensional CNN vector for the image, and passed on to a multi-layer perceptron with fully connected layers. The last layer is once again softmax, and provides us with a probability distribution over the possible outputs.</p>

<p>A single <code>train_on_batch</code> method call in Keras expects the sequences to be of the same length (so that is can be represented as a Theano Tensor). There has been a lot of discussion regarding training LSTMs with variable length sequences, and I used the following technique: Sorted all the questions by their length, and then processed them in batches of <code>128</code> while training. Most batches had questions of the same length (say 9 or 10 words), and there was no need of zero-padding. For the few batched that did have questions of varying length, the shorter questions were zero-padded. I was able to achieve a training speed of <strong>200 seconds/epoch</strong> on a GTX 760 GPU.</p>

<h2 id="show-me-the-numbers">Show me the numbers</h2>
<p>I trained my system on the Training Set of the VQA dataset, and evaluated performance on the validation set, following the rules of the VQA challenge. The answer produced by the Neural Net is checked against every answer provided by humans (there are ten human answers for every question). If the answer produced by the neural net <em>exactly</em> matches <em>at least</em> three of the ten answers, then we classify it as a correct prediction. Here is the performance of the models that I trained:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Model</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Accuracy</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>BOW+CNN</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">48.46%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LSTM-Language only</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">44.17%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>LSTM+CNN</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">51.63%</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: The results that I reported earlier were based on a metric slightly different from the ones used on VQA. They have since been updated. Also, I was able to obtain a performance of <strong>53.34%</strong> on the test-dev set (LSTM+CNN), which is practically the same as those set by the VQA authors in their LSTM baseline.</p>

<p>It’s interesting to see that even a “blind” model is able to obtain an accuracy of 44.17%. This shows that the model is pretty good at guessing the answers once it has identified the type of question. The LSTM+CNN model shows an improvement of about 3% as compared to the Feedforward Model (BOW+CNN), which tells us that the temporal structure of the question is indeed helpful. These results are in line with what was obtained in the <a href="http://www.visualqa.org/VQA_ICCV2015.pdf">original VQA paper</a>. However, the results reported in the paper were on the <em>test</em> set (trained on train+val), while we have evaluated on the <em>validation</em> set (trained on only train). If we learn a model on both the training and the validation data, then we can expect a significant improvement in performance since the number of training examples will increase by 50%. Finally, there is a lot of scope for hyperparameter tuning (number of hidden units, number of MLP hidden layers, number of LSTM layers, dropout or no dropout etc.).</p>

<p>I carried out my experiments for 100 epochs<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, and observed the following curve:</p>

<p><img src="/images/vqa/learning_curve.jpg" alt="Validation Accuracy with number of epochs" /></p>

<p>The LSTM+CNN model flattens out in performance after about 50 epochs. The BOW+CNN also showed similar behavior, but took a surprising dive at epoch 90, which was soon rectified by the 100th epoch. I’ll probably re-initialize and run the models for 500 epochs, and see if such behavior is seen again or not. <strong>Update</strong>: I did run it once more, and the dip was not observed!</p>

<h3 id="a-note-on-word-embeddings">A note on word embeddings</h3>
<p>We have a number of choices when using word embeddings, and I experimented with three of them:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/">GloVe Word Embeddings</a> trained on the common-crawl: These gave the best performance, and all results reported here are using these embeddings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://levyomer.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/dependency-based-word-embeddings/">Goldberg and Levy 2014</a>: These are the default embeddings that come with <a href="http://spacy.io/">spaCy</a>, and they gave significantly worse results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Embeddings Trained on the VQA questions: I used <a href="https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html">Gensim’s word2vec</a> implementation to train my own embeddings on the questions in the training set of the VQA dataset. The performance was similar to, but slighly worse than the GloVe embeddings. This is primarily because the VQA training set alone is not sufficiently large (~2.5m words) to get reasonable word vectors, especially for less common words.</p>
